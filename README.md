# Pablo Ariza project - Data cleaning & wrangling

The goal of this project is to combine everything you have learned about data
wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas so you can see how it all works
together. 

## TODOs

1. Cleaning
    1. Toy model 1: demographics
        1. For the demographics study we look at the two columns: Age, Sex.
        2. For the Age, I tryied to drop non valid ages
        3. I have used reg ex in order to format Ages to be "XX"
        4. For the column Sex, has been easier. I dropped all values that were not F and M.

    2. Toy model 2: space-time statistics
         1. As for the date, I have used months using reg ex and later on transforming its type to datetime stamp.
        2. The column Country was already 'cleaned'.
   
2. Analysis: Used matplotlib to see relations anf further information.
3. Conclusions.
